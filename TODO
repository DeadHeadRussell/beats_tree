Technical issues:
- No auth / security
- Cannot handle large audio (eg, wav / raw)
- Code is around a decade old, and it shows, but is simple enough for a relatively quick rewrite
- UI is rough, had no design thought put into it
- No audio parsing is done, just plays all parts blindly from beginning to end
-- Eg, what if the parts are different length?
-- Normalizing gain / volume (I have gain nodes built in, just no UI to control them)


Possible fancy features
- Lots of opportunities for fancy displays / animations
- Potential for graph instead of tree.
-- Multiple root nodes
-- Non-linear combination of stems
- Different playback algorithms
-- only neighbours
-- visit all in some order
-- sync to tempo
-- sync to sections? Dunno how that would work when sections aren't even guaranteed to match between parts
